class BoardView:
    """
    Immutable, read-only view of the Minesweeper board.

    Designed for use by UI or AI agents, providing access to only
    the visible, legitimate information a player would know:
    
    - Cell state (HIDDEN, FLAGGED, REVEALED)
    - Adjacent mine counts (for revealed non-mine cells only)
    
    This class performs no copying and does not expose any mutation methods.
    Internally, it shares the original Cell objects for performance (O(1) to create).
